"""
app/__init__.py — Application Factory
=======================================

WHAT IS THIS FILE?
This is the "brain" of the Flask backend. It creates and configures the
entire Flask application. This pattern is called the "Application Factory".

WHAT IS AN APPLICATION FACTORY?
Instead of creating the Flask app at the top of a file (like tutorials show),
we create it inside a function. Why?

  1. TESTING:  You can create different app instances for testing vs production
  2. MULTIPLE APPS:  You could run two versions of the app at once
  3. CLEAN IMPORTS:  No circular import problems
  4. INDUSTRY STANDARD:  Every serious Flask project uses this

HOW IT WORKS:
  1. create_app() is called from run.py
  2. It creates a Flask instance
  3. Loads configuration (database URL, secret key, etc.)
  4. Initializes extensions (SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow, Migrate)
  5. Registers blueprints (groups of routes for each module)
  6. Returns the fully configured app

WHAT IS A BLUEPRINT?
Think of a blueprint as a "mini-app". Each module (inventory, products, etc.)
is a blueprint with its own routes. Blueprints prevent URL conflicts and
let team members work independently.

    # ---- Step 3: Enable CORS ----
    # CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
    #
    # Problem: React runs on port 3000, Flask runs on port 5000.
